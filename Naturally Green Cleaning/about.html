					<p>
					<img src="./img/DanieTrailhead.jpg" align="right" alt="Hiking in Fairbanks, Alaska" width='400'>
					Our business started on the beautiful Oregon Coast, nine years ago, as a way to make sure people had the option of a clean home and enjoy
					life at the beach.  Life took a turn North to amazing Alaska, truly the final frontier of pristine land and immense beauty.  Now we have
					returned to Oregon to continue providing green cleaning!
					<br><br>
					We currently operate in Waldport Oregon areas!
					<br><br>
					All of these wonderful locations show, everyday, the importance of being green, ecofriendly, and how big of a role we all play in helping to keep this 
					amazing planet healthy.
					</p>
					<h1 id="greencleaning"> What is Green Cleaning?</h1>
					<p>
					Green cleaning is an environmentally friendly approach to cleaning.  From the cleaning products to procedures in cleaning to making 
					sure homes are clean & healthy for you, your family, your pets & environment.  All of our products are low or non-VOC (volatile organic chemical)
					and non-toxic.  
					<br><br>
					Cleaning shouldn't come at the cost of health.   Your floors, bathrooms, home will sparkle with our residue free products! 
					No need  of washing cleaning products off your clean home before you can use it!  
					After all, who wants to relax in their tub that's floating with leftover cleaning products! 
					<br><br>
					That's why we are Naturally Green Cleaning!
